{-| A Firebase location, which is an opaque type
that represents a literal path into a firebase.

A location can be constructed or obtained from
- an absolute path by `fromUrl`
- relative to another location by `sub`, `parent`, `root`, `push`
- a reference by `location`

Locations are generally unvalidated until their use in a task.
The constructor functions are pure.

{-| Message about a received value.

- `subscription` can be used to correlate the response to the corresponding query.
- `value` is a Json value (and `null` when the queried location doesn't exist).
- `existing` is `False` iff there is no value at the location, which can only occur in `valueChanged`-queries
- `reference` points to the queried location
- `key` is relevant particular for child queries and specifies the key of the data.
- `prevKey` specifies the key of previous child (or Nothing for the first child), revealing the ordering. It's always Nothing for valueChanged queries.
- `priority` returns the given priority of the data.

{-| Construct a new child location using a to-be-generated key.

A unique key is generated whenever the location is used in one of the tasks,
notably `open`or `set`.
Keys are prefixed with a client-generated timestamp so that a resulting list
will be chronologically-sorted.

You may `open` the location or use `set` to actually generate the key
and get its name.

{-| Actually open a location, which results in a reference
(if the location is valid).

It's generally not necessary to explicitly open a constructed location.
It can be used to check the location and to cache Firebase references.

The task fails if the location construct is invalid.

    openTask =
      (open <| sub user <| fromUrl "https://elmfire.firebaseio-demo.com/users")

The task completes with a reference to the changed location when
synchronization to the Firebase servers has completed.
The task may result in an error if the location is invalid
or you have no permission to write this data.

{-| Delete a Firebase location.

synchronization to the Firebase servers has completed.
The task may result in an error if the location is invalid
or you have no permission to remove this data.
-}
remove : Location -> Task Error Reference
remove = Native.ElmFire.remove False

{-| Transaction: Atomically modify the data at a location

First parameter is a function which will be passed the current data stored at this location (or Nothing if the location contains no data).
The function returns an Action, which is either Set Value, or Abort, or Remove.
The second parameter specifies the location at which the transaction should be performed.
The third parameter denotes whether intermediate states are reported to local query subscriptions (True) or suppressed (False).

On success the task returns a tuple:
Its first element indicates whether the transaction was commited (True) or aborted (False).
Regardless, the second element is a Snapshot containing the resulting data at that location.

{-| Query a Firebase location by subscription

(This early version of ElmFire only supports simple value queries,
without ordering and filtering.)

On success the task returns a Subscription,
which can be used to match the corresponding responses
and to unsubscribe the query.

The query results are reported via running a supplied task.

The first parameter is a function used to construct that task from a response.

The second parameter is a function used to construct a task that is run
when the query gets canceled.

The third parameter specifies the event to listen to:
`valueChanged`, `childAdded`, `childChanged`, `childRemoved` or `childMoved`.
Additionally, this parameter can also specify ordering, filtering and limiting of the query (see below).

The fourth parameter specifies the location to be queried.

can decide whether to run a task or not.

{-| Query a Firebase location once

On success the tasks results in the desired Snapshot.
It results in an error if either the location is invalid
or you have no permission to read this data.

The third parameter specifies the event to listen to:
`valueChanged`, `childAdded`, `childChanged`, `childRemoved` or `childMoved`.
Additionally, this parameter can also specify ordering, filtering and limiting of the query (see below).

The second parameter specifies the location to be queried.
-}
